This repository contains relevant codes for the PSID.

If you used the Stata but did not know how to construct panel data, this repository would be useful for you.

No serious Stata skills are required, but at least you'd know how to change your working directories.

Examples contain consumption, wealth, income, and some demographic variables. You can extend/modify your panel data on your own.

PSID data is based on questionnaire, and the questions vary year to year. 

Each sub folder contains raw-data folder. You can see what questions I used to construct.

Merging data is easy once you'd know how to identify each individual using 'pid'.
