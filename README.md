This repository contains relevant codes for the PSID.

If you used the Stata but did not know how to construct panel data, this repository would help you.

No serious Stata skills are required, but at least you'd know how to change the directories.

Examples contain consumption, wealth, income, and some demographic variables. You can extend/modify your panel data on your own.
